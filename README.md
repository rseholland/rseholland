- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ross
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently studing Remote Sensing and Environmental Mapping (MSc) at University College London
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in the ways in which we can apply remote sensing and Earth observation data to help solve pressing environmental issues.
- ğŸ–¥ The coding and software requirements of working with RS and EO data is fairly new to me so I am sharing my journey of improving my coding skills on Github.
- ğŸ“« My email is ucfars4@ucl.ac.uk 
- ğŸš² In my spare time I ride bicycles. I am a semi-professional road cyclist with UCI Continetal Team Saint Piran.
